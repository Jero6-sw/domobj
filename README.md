# Object on Domotic Wifi Server controlled using MQTT
DIY controller software for an object based on ESP8266/ESP32, to control servos, discretes, or get sensors, TIC (linky comm).

!!! Created based on https://github.com/kotope/blinds2mqtt project !!!

Tried to have a more generic code in order to not only control servos actuators, but also digital pins, and get digital, analog pins, and also get teleinfo status from linkee electricity meter

I don't use home assistant, so JSON is facultative for me.
